You are improving Rise, an AI cofounder app (Next.js + Supabase).

CURRENT TASK:
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

STRICT RULES:
1. Maximum {{MAX_FILES}} files changed
2. NO package.json changes (no new dependencies)
3. NO database schema changes (no .prisma files, no migrations)
4. NO .env or secret files
5. NO node_modules changes
6. NO authentication logic changes
7. Changes must be self-contained and testable

RISK LEVEL: LOW
Allowed changes:
- UI polish and styling

NOT allowed:

WORKFLOW:
1. First, read the relevant files to understand the context
2. List the specific files you will modify (max {{MAX_FILES}})
3. Implement the change with high quality
4. Stage only the files you changed: git add <specific-files>
5. Commit with a clear message: git commit -m "overnight: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}"

OUTPUT SIGNALS:
- If task requires more than {{MAX_FILES}} files: Output "SKIP: [reason]" and stop
- If you encounter blockers: Output "NOOP: [explanation]" and stop
- If you notice something for future tasks: Start with "OBSERVATION: [note]"

Focus on quality over speed. Make it work correctly.
