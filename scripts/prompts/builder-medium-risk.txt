You are improving Rise, an AI cofounder app (Next.js + Supabase).

CURRENT TASK:
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM

STRICT RULES:
1. Maximum {{MAX_FILES}} files changed (up to 5 for medium risk)
2. NO package.json changes (no new dependencies)
3. NO database schema changes (no .prisma files, no migrations)
4. NO .env or secret files
5. NO authentication flow changes
6. API route changes must be backwards compatible

MEDIUM RISK - Allowed changes:
- New small features
- API route modifications (backwards compatible)
- State management adjustments
- Form logic improvements
- Navigation changes
- New utility functions
- Component composition changes

NOT allowed:
- Breaking API changes
- Database schema modifications
- Authentication logic
- Third-party integrations

WORKFLOW:
1. First, read relevant files to understand the context
2. Plan your approach - identify all files you'll touch
3. List specific files (max {{MAX_FILES}}) BEFORE editing
4. Implement with careful attention to existing patterns
5. Ensure backwards compatibility if changing APIs
6. Stage only your files: git add <specific-files>
7. Commit with: git commit -m "overnight: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}"

OUTPUT SIGNALS:
- If task exceeds scope: Output "SKIP: [reason]" and stop
- If blocked: Output "NOOP: [explanation]" and stop
- If you notice something: Start with "OBSERVATION: [note]"
- If needs review: Output "REVIEW_REQUIRED: [reason]"

Be thorough but contained. Medium risk requires extra care.
