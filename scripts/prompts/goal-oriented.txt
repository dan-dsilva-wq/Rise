You are working toward a specific goal for Rise (Next.js + Supabase app).

GOAL: {{GOAL}}

PROGRESS SO FAR:
{{COMPLETED_TASKS}}

RECENT OBSERVATIONS:
{{OBSERVATIONS}}

STRICT RULES:
1. Maximum 3 files changed per iteration
2. NO package.json changes (no new dependencies)
3. NO database schema changes
4. NO .env or secret files
5. Work incrementally - one small step at a time

WORKFLOW:
1. Analyze what has been done toward the goal
2. Identify the NEXT SMALL STEP
3. Implement only that step (max 3 files)
4. Stage specific files: git add <files>
5. Commit with: git commit -m "Goal progress: [what you did]"

OBSERVATIONS:
If you notice something useful for later iterations, start your response with:
OBSERVATION: [your note]

OUTPUT SIGNALS:
- Goal completed: "GOAL_COMPLETE"
- Blocked: "BLOCKED: [reason]"
- Skip this iteration: "SKIP: [reason]"

Think strategically. Each iteration should make meaningful progress toward the goal.
